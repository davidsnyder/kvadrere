h1. Kvadrere

Apache Pig UDF TileGeometry for dividing GeoJSON geometries into square polygons at varying resolutions. 

Quadkeys were used as the basis for determining tile resolution (how big the tiles are).  A thorough introduction to quadkeys can be found "here":http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx 

Zoom level for quadkeys ranges from 1 to 23, with 1 being approx. 78km per pixel to 23 which is a fraction of a meter per pixel.  ZL 11 is often a good middle ground.  The full breakdown can be found at the link above.

h3. Usage

1. Running @mvn package@ should build the UDF JAR into @target/@

2. The test input is @test/data/admin0_MX.geojson@ which contains a single GeoJSON Feature MultiPolygon for Mexico.

3. You can inspect the file in QGIS: @qgis test/data/admin0_MX.geojson@

!kvadrere/raw/master/test/admin0_MX.png!

4. Run @./test/test_tile_geometry.sh@ which will produce @mexico_tiles_Z11.geojson@, a FeatureCollection of quadkey tiles at ZL 11.

This bash script runs @test/tile_geometries.pig@, a simple Pig runner script which calls out to the TileGeometry UDF.

5. Inspect the output in QGIS with @qgis test/mexico_tiles_Z11.geojson@

!kvadrere/raw/master/test/admin0_MX_tiledZ11.png!

<pre><code>wc -l admin0_MX_tiled_Z11/*
6735 admin0_MX_tiled_Z11/part-m-00000
</code></pre>

The routine has produced 6735 tiles at zoom level 11. 

h4. Notes 

Multiple GeoJSON shapes do NOT need to be in a feature collection, just one on each line of the input file. See @test/data@

For a GeoJSON point, the UDF will compute the quadkey and return tuple (quadkey,point) where point is the GeoJSON Feature with a new attached property 'quadkey'.

p. For a GeoJSON polygon, the UDF will slice the shape on tile boundaries, yielding (quadkey,polygon_slice) for each portion,
   where polygon_slice is a subgeometry of the parent polygon with regurgitated properties from the parent, and a new property 'quadkey'.

The @simple-json@ library I used to re-serialize the JSON escapes forward slashes, but this is valid JSON and any JSON parser should handle them correctly. 

One of the meanings of the Norwegian word 'kvadrere' is to divide something into squares.
